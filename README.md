# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-Using-Kaggle-Trees-Dataset

This repository presents a complete Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset of **511 trees**, showcasing techniques to analyze and visualize structured tabular data. The notebook is designed to extract meaningful insights, patterns, and relationships within the data before any predictive modeling.

## Project Overview

The dataset (`trees.xlsx`) contains measurements and attributes of 511 individual trees. This project applies EDA methods to:

- Clean and preprocess the dataset
- Summarize key statistics
- Visualize distributions and correlations
- Understand relationships between tree attributes

Although this analysis is based on tree data, the notebook serves as a **reusable EDA template** for similar datasets.

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x  
- pandas  
- matplotlib  
- seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook
